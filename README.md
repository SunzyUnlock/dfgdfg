The easiest way to personalise your Discord server.

There's more info below, but you don't have to read it. If you're ready press <strong>Clear All</strong> in the top of the editor to get started.

Discohook has a <a href="https://discohook.app/discord" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">support server</a>, if you need help feel free to join in and ask questions, suggest features, or just chat with the community.

We also have <a href="https://discohook.app/bot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">complementary bot</a> that may help out, featuring reaction roles and other utilities.

The main way it does this is using <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">webhooks</a>, which allows services like Discohook to send any messages with embeds to your server.

To get started with sending messages, you need a webhook URL, you can get one via the "Integrations" tab in your server's settings. If you're having issues creating a webhook, <a href="https://discohook.app/bot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">the bot</a> can help you create one for you.

Keep in mind that Discohook can't do automation yet, it only sends messages when you tell it to. If you are looking for an automatic feed or custom commands this isn't the right tool for you.</div></div></div></div><div style="border-color:#58b9ff" class="z4zgh4-0 jiJPTS"><div class="sc-3qrykn-0 bdFBtt"><span class="sc-3qrykn-1 bsDYtY"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">Discord bot</div></span><div class="sc-3qrykn-3 hXMbfy"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">Discohook has a bot as well, it's not strictly required to send messages it may be helpful to have it ready.

Below is a small but incomplete overview of what the bot can do for you.</div></div><div class="sc-3qrykn-4 hQKgZF"><div style="grid-column:1 / 13" class="rgqgux-0 dQAxvm"><div class="rgqgux-1 dHHIIV"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">Getting special formatting for mentions, channels, and emoji</div></div><div class="rgqgux-2 crjlCq"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">The <strong>/format</strong> command of the bot can give you special formatting for use in Discord messages that lets you create mentions, tag channels, or use emoji ready to paste into the editor!

There are <a href="https://discord.dev/reference#message-formatting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">manual ways</a> of doing this, but it's very error prone. The bot will make sure you'll always get the right formatting for your needs.</div></div></div><div style="grid-column:1 / 13" class="rgqgux-0 dQAxvm"><div class="rgqgux-1 dHHIIV"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">Creating reaction roles</div></div><div class="rgqgux-2 crjlCq"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">You can manage reaction roles with the bot using the <strong>/reaction-role</strong> command.

The set-up process is very intuitive: type out <strong>/reaction-role create</strong>, paste a message link, select an emoji, and pick a role. Hit enter and you're done, your members can now react to any of your messages to pick their roles.</div></div></div><div style="grid-column:1 / 13" class="rgqgux-0 dQAxvm"><div class="rgqgux-1 dHHIIV"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">Recover Discohook messages from your server</div></div><div class="rgqgux-2 crjlCq"><div class="sc-27l7o2-0 heOpKb">It can also restore any message sent in your Discord server for you via the apps menu.
